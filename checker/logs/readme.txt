What Is This?
-------------

This directory will contain auto-generated log files, named X_log.txt and X_statistics.csv, X here is a reference to used batch file index.
Its important to precise that user's solution file should be named X_solution.csv with X identical to used batch and defects file index.
Those log files will help the user to understand what constraint is violated to locate easier the problem source.


How To Use The Examples
-----------------------
Log files are auto-generated by the Checker algorithm.
Log files will indicate user's solution errors in case of constraint violation or, on the other hand, a constraint successful verification.
