What Is This?
-------------

This set of batchs and defects is provided by Saint-Gobain Glass France for the ROADEF/EURO Challenge 2018, and is intended to provide working examples,
in order to help developers to provide them a way to test their algorithms.

User's generated solution instances should be placed in this directory as well.

A generated solution, if it has used A0_batch instance which's associated to A0_defects instance, 
will inevitably take the same instance index which's A0 in this case, result is A0_solution as solution instance file name.


How To Use The Examples
-----------------------
For user's solution generation, use AX_batch instance associated with AX_defects instance file. 
Once user's solution is generated, the user should execute the Checker algorithm to validate or not it's solution.
In Checker console, the index to enter is the same index of used AX_batch, AX_solution and AX_defects files which's X in our case.
